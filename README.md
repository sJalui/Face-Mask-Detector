## 🌟 Features  

✅ **Real-Time Mask Detection:** Detects faces with and without masks instantly.  
✅ **Efficient Model:** Powered by **TensorFlow** and **MobileNetV2** for lightweight performance.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface:** A seamless experience with Flask and OpenCV integration.  
✅ **Highly Customizable:** Modify and enhance as needed for your own use case!  

---

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works  

1. **Capture Input:** The system uses your camera feed or input video.  
2. **Process Frames:** Frames are analyzed using a pre-trained deep learning model.  
3. **Output Results:** It displays bounding boxes around faces and labels them as "With Mask" or "Without Mask".  

Here’s a visual flow:  

**Input 📷 ➡️ Preprocessing 🔄 ➡️ Model Inference 💻 ➡️ Output ✅**

## 🔧 Technologies  

The project is built using the following technologies and libraries:  

- 📦 **Flask:** Web framework for serving the application.  
- 🧠 **TensorFlow/Keras:** For the deep learning model.  
- 📹 **OpenCV:** For real-time video stream processing.  
- 🔊 **PyDub:** For optional audio notifications.

## ⚙️ Installation  

Clone the repository and install the dependencies. 🚀  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python keras imutils
pip install flask tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python imutils matplotlib

```
Install any other libraries mentioned in subsequent error messages (e.g., Response, jsonify are part of Flask, so you won't need separate installations for them).
```bash
pip install flask <other-missing-library>
```

### 4️⃣ Watch the Magic Happen ✨  
- The app will visually highlight detected faces with:  
  - ✅ **Green for Masked Faces**  
![WithMask](https://github.com/sJalui/Face-Mask-Detector/blob/main/images/w_mask.png?raw=true)
  - ❌ **Red for Unmasked Faces**  
![WithoutMask]()
Enjoy tracking results in real-time, whether for safety monitoring or research purposes! 🚀  
### 5️⃣ Interact with the Chatbot 🤖  
Our app also comes with a built-in **AI-powered chatbot** leveraging the **Gemini API**:  
- 💬 **Get Guidance:** Ask the chatbot about features, face mask safety, or technical queries.  
- ⚙️ **Seamless Experience:** Integrated within the app for a smoother user experience.  
- 🌟 **Intelligence at Your Fingertips:** Get instant answers while using the application!  

Let the chatbot enhance your interaction and provide smart support!
